# Quantum Computing Language Simulator

This directory contains a from-scratch implementation of a quantum computing programming language and simulator in C (similar to Qiskit).

## Goal
Build a quantum computing simulator to understand:
- Quantum bits (qubits) and superposition
- Quantum gates and operations
- Quantum circuits
- Measurement and observation
- Quantum algorithms (Grover's, Shor's, etc.)

## Learning Path
1. Implement qubit representation using complex numbers
2. Build basic quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, Pauli gates)
3. Create quantum circuit simulator
4. Implement measurement operations
5. Build quantum algorithms
6. Add visualization and debugging tools
