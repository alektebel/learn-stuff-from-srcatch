# Lean Proofs

This directory contains mathematical proofs implemented in Lean, progressing toward proving Galois theorem.

## Goal
Learn theorem proving and formal mathematics by building progressively harder proofs leading to Galois theorem.

## Learning Path

### Foundations
1. **Basic Logic** - Propositional and predicate logic
2. **Set Theory** - Sets, relations, functions
3. **Natural Numbers** - Peano axioms, induction

### Algebra Basics
4. **Groups** - Group axioms, subgroups, homomorphisms
5. **Rings** - Ring theory, ideals, quotient rings
6. **Fields** - Field axioms, field extensions

### Advanced Algebra
7. **Polynomials** - Polynomial rings, roots, irreducibility
8. **Field Extensions** - Algebraic extensions, degree of extensions
9. **Splitting Fields** - Construction and properties
10. **Galois Theory** - Galois groups, fundamental theorem

### Ultimate Goal
**Galois Theorem** - Correspondence between field extensions and group theory
