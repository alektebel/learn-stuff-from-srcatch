2. **Study the theory** from recommended resources
3. **Attempt proofs** yourself using Lean tactics
4. **Check solutions** for reference when stuck
5. **Understand deeply** - don't just copy proofs

### Lean Development Workflow
```bash
# Install Lean 4
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh

# Create a Lean project
lake new my_galois_project
cd my_galois_project

code .

# Build and check proofs
lake build
```

### Using VS Code with Lean

## 🎓 Learning Tips

### General Strategy
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with BasicLogic even if you know the content
2. **Be Patient**: Galois theory is deep - expect 3-4 months of study
3. **Prove Everything**: Don't skip proofs or use `sorry` unless experimenting
4. **Use Mathlib**: Lean's math library has many helper lemmas
5. **Ask for Help**: The Lean community is very welcoming

### Debugging Proofs
- Read error messages carefully - they're usually helpful
- Check the tactic state frequently
- Break complex proofs into smaller lemmas
- Use `sorry` temporarily to see if rest of proof works
- Compare with similar proofs in Mathlib

### Common Pitfalls
- Not understanding the difference between definitional and propositional equality
- Forgetting to introduce hypotheses with `intro`
- Misusing `apply` vs `exact`
- Not checking implicit arguments
- Trying to prove too much at once
