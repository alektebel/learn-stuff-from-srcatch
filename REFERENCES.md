# References

One canonical source per mechanism, by week. Where a directory already carries
its own reading list, this points at it rather than repeating it.

**Two rules.** Read the primary source, not a summary of it — most of these are
short, and the summaries drop exactly the caveat that matters. And when a demo
here disagrees with a paper, the paper is probably right and the disagreement is
the interesting part: write it down.

---

## Week 1 · [`aws-from-scratch/`](week-01/aws-from-scratch/)

- **IAM policy evaluation logic** — AWS docs, *Policy evaluation logic*. The
  three-line rule the whole directory is gated on.
- DeCandia et al., **"Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key-value Store"**, SOSP
  2007 — what DynamoDB's partition key inherits. Built in full in week 10.
- **AWS Well-Architected Framework** — the six pillars, revisited in week 12.
- The current **AWS price list**, for anything `pricing.py` asserts. The ratios
  in the demo are right; the absolute numbers are dated by design.

## Week 2 · [`autograd/`](week-02/autograd/)

- Baydin, Pearlmutter, Radul & Siskind, **"Automatic Differentiation in Machine
  Learning: a Survey"**, JMLR 2018 — why reverse mode, and the forward/reverse
  cost asymmetry the demo measures.
- Griewank & Walther, **"Evaluating Derivatives"**, 2008 — the book, if the
  survey leaves you wanting the proofs.
- Glorot & Bengio, AISTATS 2010; He et al., **"Delving Deep into Rectifiers"**,
  ICCV 2015 — the two initialisation scales, and why ReLU needs the second.
- Kingma & Ba, **"Adam"**, ICLR 2015 — read §2 for bias correction, then check
  which direction it cuts before writing anything about it.
- Loshchilov & Hutter, **"Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization"**, ICLR 2019 —
  AdamW, and why L2 and weight decay are not the same under Adam.
- Srivastava et al., **"Dropout"**, JMLR 2014 — including the inverted scaling.
- Kingma & Welling, **"Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes"**, ICLR 2014 — the
  reparameterisation trick in `generative.py`.

  Subword Units"**, ACL 2016 — BPE, and why merges apply in rank order.
- Ba, Kiros & Hinton, **"Layer Normalization"**, 2016.
- Xiong et al., **"On Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture"**,
  ICML 2020 — why pre-norm trains without a warmup and post-norm does not.

- Holtzman et al., **"The Curious Case of Neural Text Degeneration"**, ICLR 2020
  — top-p, and why greedy decoding produces text nobody would write.
- Raschka, **Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)**; Karpathy, **nanoGPT**
  — the two best walk-throughs if you get stuck on shapes.

### `distill.py` specifically

- Hinton, Vinyals & Dean, **"Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network"**,
  2015 — the T² correction is §2.
- Wang et al., **"MiniLM"**, NeurIPS 2020 — attention and value-relation
  transfer, and why it needs no layer mapping.
- Agarwal et al., **"GKD: Generalized Knowledge Distillation"**, 2023 — the β
  family, and on-policy sampling.
- Rafailov et al., **"Direct Preference Optimization"**, NeurIPS 2023 — the
  identity in §4 is the one `methods.py` round-trips.

RLHF Book, Schulman's KL note, Weng, YugeTen, Dr. GRPO, async GRPO, TRL.

  TKDE 1994 — the iterator model in `executor.py`.
- Selinger et al., **"Access Path Selection in a Relational Database Management

  Acta Informatica 1996 — the original.
- Athanassoulis et al., **"Designing Access Methods: The RUM Conjecture"**,

- The **RocksDB wiki** on leveled vs universal compaction — the clearest
  practitioner account of the same trade.
- **SAS Language Reference**, the DATA step chapter — the PDV, the implicit
  loop, `RETAIN`, BY-groups and `MERGE`. There is no paper; the manual is the
  specification, and the `MERGE` many-to-many behaviour is documented rather

  the same problems, solved declaratively, for the comparison.

## Week 10 · consensus, and its refusal

  accountable safety, and the ⅓ slashing bound `pos.py` checks.

## Week 12 · AWS certification and deployment

- The **current official exam guides** — TODO §10.10 says to diff them against
  the check list before anything else. They are the authority; this repo is not.
- **AWS Well-Architected Framework** and its lenses — [`aws-certification/wellarchitected.py`](week-12/aws-certification/).
- **AWS Security Best Practices** / IAM docs — least privilege, permission
  boundaries, and the credential resolution chain.
- **AWS Service Quotas** and the **price list API** — the two sources that
  answer "is this a limit or a bug" and "what will this cost", better than any
  documentation page.

## Week 13–14 · sockets and protocols

  for [`http-server/`](week-13/http-server/) and [`toralizer/`](week-14/toralizer/).

  for [`bash-from-scratch/`](week-13/bash-from-scratch/).

  RFC 2616, which most tutorials still cite.

  allocator and its spilling, which is what
  [`c-compiler/`](week-15/c-compiler/)'s `codegen.c` implements.

  encoding and the fetch/decode/execute loop, for

  Efficient GPU Control Flow"**, MICRO 2007 — branch divergence and the mask
  stack, and what hardware does about it.

  [`firewall-from-scratch/`](week-15/firewall-from-scratch/).
- Nielsen & Chuang, **Quantum Computation and Quantum Information** — ch. 4 for
  [`quantum-computing-lang/`](week-15/quantum-computing-lang/).

## Week 16 · [`cuda-from-scratch/`](week-16/cuda-from-scratch/)

- **NVIDIA CUDA C++ Programming Guide** and the **Best Practices Guide** — the
  primary sources, and genuinely good.
- Kirk & Hwu, **Programming Massively Parallel Processors** — the textbook.
- Harris, **"Optimizing Parallel Reduction in CUDA"** — seven versions of one
  kernel, each faster than the last, with the reason stated. The single best
  worked example of the profile-then-fix loop this week is about.
- Volkov & Demmel, **"Benchmarking GPUs to Tune Dense Linear Algebra"**, SC 2008
  — why occupancy is not the goal.

## Week 17 · patterns, light, Haskell

  Optimizers, Really?"**, VLDB 2015 — the single deepest result in query
  processing: estimation error compounds multiplicatively with join count, so

  Compiling Efficient Query Plans for Modern Hardware"**, VLDB 2011 — the two
  answers to the Volcano model's per-tuple overhead.

  [`ml-in-production/`](week-18/ml-in-production/) or [`mlops/`](week-18/mlops/).
- Olston & Najork, **"Web Crawling"**, FnTIR 2010; and **RFC 9309** (Robots
  Exclusion Protocol) — for [`web-scraping/`](week-18/web-scraping/). The RFC is
  short and is the part with obligations attached.
- Cheney, Chiticariu & Tan (week 6, above) — data lineage is provenance with the
  algebra removed, which is the right way to read
  [`sas-lineage-tool/`](week-18/sas-lineage-tool/) after week 6.

## Daily · [`lean-proofs/`](lean-proofs/)

- Avigad, de Moura, Kong & Ullrich, **Theorem Proving in Lean 4** — the manual.
- **Mathematics in Lean** — the tutorial that matches this directory's ladder.
- Artin, **Algebra**, ch. 14–16 — the mathematics the Galois track is formalising.

## Not scheduled · [`reference/`](reference/)

Those five directories carry their own reading lists. `vllm-engine` and
`tensorrt-inference` are where you go **after** week 4, with your own scheduler
open beside them. The primary sources, so you can read without opening them:

- [`vllm-engine/`](reference/vllm-engine/) — Kwon et al., **PagedAttention**,
  SOSP 2023. The same paper as week 3 and week 4; read it a third time here,
  against your own block allocator.
- [`tensorrt-inference/`](reference/tensorrt-inference/) — the **NVIDIA TensorRT
  Developer Guide**, on layer fusion, precision calibration and kernel
  auto-tuning. Vendor documentation, and the honest place for it.
- [`ml-inference/`](reference/ml-inference/) — Jacob et al., **"Quantization and
  Training of Neural Networks for Efficient Integer-Arithmetic-Only
  Inference"**, CVPR 2018; and Dettmers et al., **"LLM.int8()"**, 2022, for what
  changes at transformer scale.
- [`world-models/`](reference/world-models/) — Ha & Schmidhuber, **"World
  Models"**, 2018; then Hafner et al., **Dreamer** v1 (ICLR 2020), v2 (ICLR
  2021) and v3 (2023); then Micheli et al., **IRIS**, ICLR 2023.

## Method, not content

- Ericsson, Krampe & Tesch-Römer, **"The Role of Deliberate Practice"**, 1993 —
  the predict-then-run loop is deliberate practice; the checkers are the
  immediate feedback it requires.
- Roediger & Karpicke, **"Test-Enhanced Learning"**, 2006 — why `drill.py` and
  `defend.py` are separate from `check.py`, and why retrieval beats review.
