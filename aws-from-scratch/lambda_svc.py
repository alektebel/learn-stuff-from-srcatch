"""
Lambda — invocation, concurrency and cold starts. Complete Solution.

DESIGN DECISION — how to model a "container"?
  You could invoke the handler directly and call it done.
  CHOSEN: model the execution ENVIRONMENT explicitly, with a lifetime and
  reusable state. That is what makes cold starts, warm state and the
  "why is my global variable still there" question demonstrable — and global
  state surviving between invocations is the single most common Lambda bug.

DESIGN DECISION — one concurrency number, or reserved plus unreserved?
  CHOSEN: both. Reserved concurrency is a floor AND a ceiling: it guarantees a
  function that much capacity and forbids it more. Setting it on one function
  silently reduces what every other function can use, which is a failure mode
  worth feeling once.

DESIGN DECISION — how do sync and async invocations differ?
  CHOSEN: model both. Synchronous throttling returns a 429 to the caller;
  asynchronous throttling is retried internally, and only after the retries
  are exhausted does the event go to a dead-letter destination. Same function,
  completely different failure behaviour.
