S3 — object storage. Complete Solution.

DESIGN DECISION — a filesystem, or a flat key-value store?
  S3 looks like it has folders. It does not. `reports/2024/q1.csv` is one
  opaque key that happens to contain slashes; "folders" are an illusion the
  console builds by splitting on a delimiter at list time.
  CHOSEN: a flat dict, with prefix/delimiter emulated in list_objects. Building
  it flat is what makes the consequences obvious — renaming a "folder" is
  O(objects), not O(1), and there is no such thing as an empty one.

DESIGN DECISION — how to model versioning?
  Simplest is a per-key list of versions with a pointer to the current one.
  CHOSEN: that, plus the detail that makes versioning surprising: DELETE does
  not delete. It pushes a DELETE MARKER on top. The data is still billed for,
  still there, and a plain GET now 404s while a versioned GET succeeds. That
  single behaviour explains most "why is my bucket still huge" tickets.
