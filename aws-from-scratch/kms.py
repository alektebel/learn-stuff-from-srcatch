KMS — envelope encryption. Complete Solution.

DESIGN DECISION — encrypt data with the master key, or with a data key?
  Encrypting directly with the KMS key means every byte crosses the network to
  a service that caps payloads at 4KB, and rotating the key means re-encrypting
  everything you own.
  CHOSEN: ENVELOPE encryption. KMS generates a random data key, hands you it
  twice — plaintext and encrypted-under-the-master-key — and forgets it. You
  encrypt locally with the plaintext copy, throw it away, and store the
  encrypted copy next to the ciphertext.
  The consequences are the whole lesson: unlimited data size, one network call
  per object rather than per byte, and key rotation that re-encrypts KEYS
  rather than DATA.

DESIGN DECISION — what is "rotation"?
  The intuitive answer is "make a new key and re-encrypt everything".
  CHOSEN: model what actually happens — a new key VERSION is created for new
  encryptions, and old versions are retained so old ciphertext still decrypts.
  Rotation that broke old data would not be rotation, it would be an outage.

The cipher here is XOR. It is NOT encryption and the file says so loudly. The
structure — data keys, wrapping, context, rotation — is the lesson; substitute
AES-GCM and nothing about the shape changes.
