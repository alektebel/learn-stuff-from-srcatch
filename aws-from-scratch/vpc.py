"""
VPC — CIDR, routing, and the difference that causes the most confusion:
security groups are STATEFUL, network ACLs are NOT. Complete Solution.

DESIGN DECISION — model packets, or model rules?
  Evaluating rules in isolation tells you what a rule says. It does not tell
  you whether a connection works, and "the rule looks right but it does not
  connect" is the entire genre of VPC bug.
  CHOSEN: model a CONNECTION — a request packet and its reply — and evaluate
  both directions. The stateful/stateless difference then appears as a
  behavioural result rather than a fact to memorise: the same ruleset that
  works for a security group silently drops the RETURN traffic on a NACL.

DESIGN DECISION — how much CIDR arithmetic to implement?
  Python has `ipaddress`. Using it would skip the part worth understanding:
  that a /24 inside a /16 is a containment test on the network address, and
  that subnets in one VPC must not overlap.
  CHOSEN: use `ipaddress` for parsing, but implement containment, overlap and
  the usable-host count by hand, since those are the numbers people get wrong.
