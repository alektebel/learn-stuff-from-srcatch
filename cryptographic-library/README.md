## Implementation Guides

The `solutions/` directory contains verbose implementation guides for each cryptographic component. These guides provide:

- **Mathematical foundations** and algorithm details
- **Step-by-step implementation instructions** without actual code
- **Data structure recommendations** and architecture design
- **Security considerations** including common vulnerabilities and mitigations
- **Testing strategies** with test vectors and validation approaches
- **Performance optimization** techniques
- **References** to standards, papers, and additional resources

Each guide is designed to help you implement the algorithm from scratch while understanding the underlying cryptographic principles and security requirements.

## Building and Testing

### Build SHA-256 Example
```bash
make sha256
./sha256
```

Or manually:
```bash
gcc -o sha256 sha256.c
./sha256
```

### Testing Your Implementations

When implementing the algorithms from the guides:

1. **Start with Test Vectors:**
   - Use NIST test vectors for validation
   - Implement basic functionality first
   - Verify against known correct outputs

2. **Incremental Testing:**
   - Test individual functions before integration
   - Use unit tests for each component
   - Validate edge cases

3. **Security Testing:**
   - Check constant-time execution where required
   - Validate all inputs before processing
   - Test error handling paths

4. **Interoperability:**
   - Compare outputs with established libraries (OpenSSL, libsodium)
   - Test encoding/decoding with standard formats
   - Verify protocol compatibility

## Security Note

⚠️ **These implementations are for educational purposes only.**

### Why You Should NOT Use These in Production:

1. **Not Audited:** Code has not undergone professional security audit
2. **Side-Channel Vulnerabilities:** May leak information through timing, power, or cache
3. **No Hardware Acceleration:** Much slower than optimized libraries
4. **Implementation Bugs:** Subtle errors can have catastrophic security consequences
5. **Maintenance:** No security updates or bug fixes

### For Production Systems, Use:

- **OpenSSL** - Industry standard, widely deployed
- **libsodium** - Modern, easy-to-use, hard-to-misuse
- **mbedTLS** - Lightweight, embedded-friendly
- **BoringSSL** - Google's OpenSSL fork
- **AWS-LC** - AWS's cryptographic library

### Educational Value:

Understanding how cryptography works "under the hood" helps you:
- Use cryptographic libraries correctly
- Understand security requirements and limitations
- Make informed architectural decisions
- Appreciate the complexity of secure implementations
- Recognize common cryptographic vulnerabilities
