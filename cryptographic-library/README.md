# Cryptographic Library

This directory contains a from-scratch implementation of a cryptographic library in C.

## Goal
Build cryptographic primitives to understand:
- Hash functions (SHA-256, SHA-3)
- Digital signatures (ECDSA)
- Public key cryptography
- Symmetric encryption
- Key derivation and management

## Learning Path
1. Implement SHA-256 hash function
2. Build elliptic curve arithmetic
3. Implement ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
4. Add AES encryption
5. Implement key exchange protocols (ECDH)
6. Add secure random number generation

## Security Note
⚠️ This is for educational purposes only. Do not use in production systems. Use established cryptographic libraries for real applications.
