"""
Radix Tree Prefix Cache (RadixAttention) — From Scratch
=======================================================
The scheme SGLang calls RadixAttention. Sequences live in a radix tree: shared
prefixes are stored once, on a shared path, and diverge exactly where the token
streams diverge.

Build it to understand:
- Token-exact matching, with no block quantisation
- Why "only leaves are evictable" makes protecting shared prefixes automatic
- Node splitting, and where reference counts have to go when you split
- Why an over-capacity cache is sometimes the correct state

Learning Path:
1. Implement match_prefix — walk edges, allow a partial match inside one
2. Implement insert, including the split when a sequence diverges mid-edge
3. Implement LRU eviction over leaves only
4. Implement pin/unpin up the ancestor chain
5. Measure hit rates and compare with prefix_cache.py on the same traffic

Background:
  Each edge holds a run of tokens and their KV entries. Walking from the root
  spells out a cached sequence. Two sequences sharing a 300-token system prompt
  share one 300-token edge — stored once, matched in full.

  Versus fixed-size block hashing:
    + Exact token granularity: a 60-token shared prefix is worth 60 tokens
    + Shared prefixes are physically shared, so eviction can reason about them
    - Splitting is more bookkeeping than a hash lookup
    - Pointer chasing costs more per lookup than one hash

  The eviction rule is the elegant part. An interior node is a prefix that some
  longer cached sequence still needs, so restricting eviction to leaves means
  "never evict a shared prefix" falls out of the data structure rather than
  being a heuristic you have to tune.

       cached part), and something unrelated (0).
