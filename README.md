# learn-stuff-from-scratch

A collection of from-scratch implementations of various systems and projects for learning purposes.

**New here? Read [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md)** — what this repo is for, and the three
principles every directory follows: design choices named as problem-solving decisions,
MVP-then-complicate driven by limit cases, and verification you can run.

## Directory Structure

### Operating Systems
- **[linux-from-scratch/](linux-from-scratch/)** - Build an OS from the first byte the CPU executes to a machine you actually use, plus a real Linux distribution compiled from source: a scaffold of 176 exercises across 15 phases (toolchain, boot, interrupts, paging, processes, SMP, filesystems, userspace, drivers, TCP/IP, isolation, LFS, real hardware, then USB/NVMe/GPU/ACPI drivers for your own machine and thirty days of running it in real service), each with the limit case that motivates it and the book or paper to read alongside it. Curriculum only - no solutions

### Low-Level Systems (C/C++)
- **[c-compiler/](c-compiler/)** - C compiler implementation in C
- **[quantum-computing-lang/](quantum-computing-lang/)** - Quantum computing language and simulator (like Qiskit) in C

## Philosophy

This repository is dedicated to learning by building things from scratch. Each directory contains:
- **Template files** with TODO comments and implementation guidelines
- **Step-by-step instructions** for gradual implementation
- **Complete solutions** in the `solutions/` folder for reference
- A clear learning path from basics to advanced topics

## Structure

Each project directory contains:

```
project-name/
├── README.md              # Project overview and learning path
├── template-files         # Empty templates with TODOs and guidelines
├── Makefile              # Build configuration (for C projects)
└── solutions/            # Complete working implementations
    ├── README.md         # Solution documentation
    └── solution-files    # Fully implemented code
```

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a project** that interests you
2. **Read the README** in that directory to understand the goals
3. **Start with the template files** - they have TODOs and guidelines
4. **Implement gradually** - follow the TODO comments step by step
5. **Test frequently** - build and test as you implement each section
6. **Check solutions** when stuck or to verify your approach
7. **Learn and iterate** - understand each step before moving forward

## Implementation Approach

The templates are designed to be:
- ✅ **Gradual**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- ✅ **Guided**: Clear TODO comments explain what to implement
- ✅ **Balanced**: Not too easy (no hand-holding), not too hard (reasonable steps)
- ✅ **Educational**: Focus on understanding concepts, not just copying code

## Building Projects

Most C projects include a Makefile:

```bash
cd project-name/
make          # Build the project
make run      # Run the program
make test     # Run tests (if available)
make clean    # Clean build artifacts
```

## Note

These implementations are for educational purposes. They prioritize clarity and understanding over production-ready features or performance. Use the solutions as reference, but try to implement yourself first for maximum learning!
