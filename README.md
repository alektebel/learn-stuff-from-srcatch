# learn-stuff-from-scratch

A collection of from-scratch implementations of various systems and projects for learning purposes.

## Directory Structure

### Low-Level Systems (C)
- **[c-compiler/](c-compiler/)** - C compiler implementation in C
- **[quantum-computing-lang/](quantum-computing-lang/)** - Quantum computing language and simulator (like Qiskit) in C
- **[cryptographic-library/](cryptographic-library/)** - Cryptographic primitives (SHA-256, ECDSA, etc.) in C
- **[bash-from-scratch/](bash-from-scratch/)** - Unix shell/terminal implementation
- **[http-server/](http-server/)** - HTTP server implementation

### Functional Programming & Formal Verification
- **[haskell-projects/](haskell-projects/)** - Various projects to learn Haskell
- **[lean-proofs/](lean-proofs/)** - Mathematical proofs in Lean, progressing toward Galois theorem

### Machine Learning & MLOps
- **[distributed-training/](distributed-training/)** - Distributed training systems (data parallelism, model parallelism, multi-node training)
- **[ml-in-production/](ml-in-production/)** - Production ML systems (model serving, monitoring, A/B testing)
- **[mlops/](mlops/)** - MLOps pipelines (experiment tracking, CI/CD, feature stores)
- **[ml-inference/](ml-inference/)** - High-performance inference (optimization, quantization, edge deployment)

## Philosophy

This repository is dedicated to learning by building things from scratch. Each directory contains:
- A clear learning path from basics to advanced topics
- Progressive implementation goals
- Documentation explaining concepts and design decisions

## Getting Started

1. Choose a project that interests you
2. Read the README in that directory
3. Follow the learning path
4. Build incrementally and understand each step

## Note

These implementations are for educational purposes. They prioritize clarity and understanding over production-ready features or performance.
