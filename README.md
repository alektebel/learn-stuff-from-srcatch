# learn-stuff-from-scratch

A collection of from-scratch implementations of various systems and projects for learning purposes.

**New here? Read [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md)** — what this repo is for, and the three
principles every directory follows: design choices named as problem-solving decisions,
MVP-then-complicate driven by limit cases, and verification you can run.

**Want the file-by-file list? Read [IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md](IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md)** —
every file you will open, in the order you will open it, with its stub count.

**Want the papers? Read [REFERENCES.md](REFERENCES.md)** — one canonical source
per mechanism, by week, with what to read each for.

**Working through it? Read [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** — an 18-week schedule (24 Aug –
27 Dec 2026) at three intensities. The daily notebook — expected work, expected
publishable, one blog post per day — lives in [`journal/`](journal/):

```bash
python3 journal/serve.py        # http://127.0.0.1:8765  (starts today, 23 Aug 2026)
```

Track where you actually are with:

```bash
python3 progress.py                 # per-directory bars, and how far behind the plan you are
python3 progress.py --checks        # also runs every check.py — the number that cannot be gamed
python3 progress.py --track spine   # the 10-directory minimum, 28 h/week
```

## The repo, in weeks

Each week folder has a `README.md` for **the current priority order** (AWS first,
then LLM work, then provenance, then distributed training, then the database,
then the rest). The code still lives where it was added; the README links to it.
**Start at [`week-01/`](week-01/)** — that is AWS, not a shell.

`lean-proofs/` stays at the root because it is not a week: it is a ~1.2 h daily
slot across all eighteen.

- **[context-caching/](week-03/context-caching/)** - LLM context caching from scratch on a tiny pure-Python transformer: KV cache, block-hash and radix-tree prefix caching, paged KV blocks with copy-on-write, semantic response caching, and cache-aware request routing (16 graded checks via `python3 check.py`)
- **[provenance-semirings/](week-06/provenance-semirings/)** - Green et al. (PODS 2007): evaluate a query once in ℕ[X], then lineage, why-provenance, bag, trust, security and min-cost are homomorphisms. If `h(Q_How)=Q_K` fails, you built an annotation scheme (8 graded checks)
- **[scasp/](week-07/scasp/)** - Goal-directed ASP: unification with occurs, SLD, Clark duals for constructive negation, coinductive success through even loops, justification trees. The result is a tree you can replay (8 graded checks)
- **[linc/](week-08/linc/)** - LINC / Logic-LM / Faithful CoT without an LLM: a pluggable parser, a prover that emits a proof, a fault injector from LINC's error analysis, a sweep of the parse-error rate, and a how-polynomial on the proof (8 graded checks)

- **[spade/](week-05/spade/)** - SPADE (PVLDB 2024): synthesise data-quality assertions from prompt-version deltas, select a minimal cover under an FFR cap, then cite each kept assertion back to its delta with ContextCite (8 graded checks)

- **[inference-from-scratch/](week-04/inference-from-scratch/)** - A serving stack on a simulated GPU, in the order you actually assemble one: the per-token path, a naive server that fails under overlap, continuous batching, KV bandwidth, a scheduler, paged KV, GPU-path opts, speculative decoding, observability, a load test, then — only then — a comparison with vLLM / SGLang / TensorRT-LLM (12 graded checks)

### System Design & Distributed Systems
- **[system-design/](reference/system-design/)** - Core distributed systems patterns: caching (LRU, cache-aside, stampede), async queues (retries, backoff, DLQ, idempotency), reliability (circuit breaker, bulkhead, backpressure), consistent hashing, leaderboards, URL shortener, rate limiter, and capacity math
- **[dynamo-paper/](week-10/dynamo-paper/)** - Amazon's Dynamo paper (SOSP 2007) implemented directly: consistent hashing with preference lists, vector clocks, N/R/W quorums, sloppy quorum with hinted handoff, Merkle-tree anti-entropy, and gossip membership (17 graded checks via `python3 check.py`)

### Operations & Reliability
- **[deploy-and-debug/](week-04/deploy-and-debug/)** - Running the systems in this repo and debugging them when they break: capacity math (KV cache sizing, N/R/W failure tolerance), percentiles/queueing/error budgets, root-cause diagnosis of 11 injected faults from metrics alone, and safe rollout (liveness vs readiness, canary analysis, budget-based auto-rollback) - plus a runbook of the real vllm/nodetool/nvidia-smi/k8s commands (12 graded checks via `python3 check.py`)

### Data Engineering & Analytics
- **[sas-lineage-tool/](week-18/sas-lineage-tool/)** - SAS field lineage parser for tracking data transformations and dependencies
- **[web-scraping/](week-18/web-scraping/)** - Industrial web scraping/crawler library (Python/C, CUDA acceleration, CAPTCHA bypass, distributed architecture)

## Philosophy

This repository is dedicated to learning by building things from scratch. Each directory contains:
- **Template files** with TODO comments and implementation guidelines
- **Step-by-step instructions** for gradual implementation
- **Complete solutions** in the `solutions/` folder for reference
- A clear learning path from basics to advanced topics

## Structure

Each project directory contains:

```
project-name/
├── README.md              # Project overview and learning path
├── template-files         # Empty templates with TODOs and guidelines
├── Makefile              # Build configuration (for C projects)
└── solutions/            # Complete working implementations
    ├── README.md         # Solution documentation
    └── solution-files    # Fully implemented code
```

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a project** that interests you
2. **Read the README** in that directory to understand the goals
3. **Start with the template files** - they have TODOs and guidelines
4. **Implement gradually** - follow the TODO comments step by step
5. **Test frequently** - build and test as you implement each section
6. **Check solutions** when stuck or to verify your approach
7. **Learn and iterate** - understand each step before moving forward

## Implementation Approach

The templates are designed to be:
- ✅ **Gradual**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- ✅ **Guided**: Clear TODO comments explain what to implement
- ✅ **Balanced**: Not too easy (no hand-holding), not too hard (reasonable steps)
- ✅ **Educational**: Focus on understanding concepts, not just copying code

## Building Projects

Most C projects include a Makefile:

```bash
cd project-name/
make          # Build the project
make run      # Run the program
make test     # Run tests (if available)
make clean    # Clean build artifacts
```

## Note

These implementations are for educational purposes. They prioritize clarity and understanding over production-ready features or performance. Use the solutions as reference, but try to implement yourself first for maximum learning!
