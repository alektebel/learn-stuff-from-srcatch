Step 4 — Cite the SQL back to schema sentences
==============================================
Join with ContextCite. The schema is the context; the SQL is the response.
The top-cited sources should be the columns the query actually uses
(employees.name, employees.id, departments.manager_id, departments.name).

If ContextCite points at employees.title, the attribution is listening
to the schema rather than to the SQL — which is the same failure mode
as whole-response attribution missing a poison sentence in contextcite/.
