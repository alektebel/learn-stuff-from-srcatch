# Progress

147 exercises. Tick as you go. The last line of each phase is for the graded
checker you write once that phase is complete — see
[README.md](README.md#verification).

Track K is the kernel (phases 00–10, 12). Track D is the distribution (phase 11),
and is best done early, in parallel with phase 02.
