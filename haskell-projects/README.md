# Haskell Projects

This directory contains various projects to learn Haskell from scratch.

## Goal
Learn Haskell by implementing real-world projects to understand:
- Functional programming paradigms
- Type systems and type inference
- Monads and functors
- Lazy evaluation
- Pure functions and immutability

## Project Ideas
1. **Simple Calculator** - Parser and evaluator
2. **JSON Parser** - Parsing and data structures
3. **Web Scraper** - HTTP requests and HTML parsing
4. **Build Tool** - File system operations and dependency management
5. **Compiler** - Lexing, parsing, and code generation
6. **Database** - Data storage and query language
7. **Web Framework** - HTTP server and routing

## Learning Path
Start with simpler projects and progressively build more complex systems.
