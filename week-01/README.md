# Week 1 · Aug 24–Aug 30, 2026

> **AWS, from its mechanisms up.**
> Start where the leverage is. Eight services, each reduced to the one mechanism that makes it behave the way it does — and then a meter and a price sheet on top, so every later week has a cost model to reason with.

## Finish this week

| Project | Hours | Track |
|---|---|---|
| [`aws-from-scratch/`](aws-from-scratch/) | 42 | core · spine |

**42 block hours**, plus the daily Lean slot (~8.4 h) = 50 h on the full track.

## What to do, in order

1. `iam.py` **first, always.** The checker enforces it and everything else in the directory is gated by it. Learn the three-line evaluation rule before anything.
2. Then `s3.py`, `sqs.py`, `dynamodb.py` — checks 1 to 9. Flat keys, the visibility-timeout limit case, and the partition key that decides everything.
3. Then `lambda_svc.py`, `sns.py`, `kms.py`, `vpc.py`, `capstone.py`.
4. Finish with the billing layer: `pricing.py`, `billing.py`, `optimize.py`. **Predict the provisioned-vs-on-demand DynamoDB crossover before running `optimize.py`.** Most people are off by an order of magnitude.
5. Start `drill.py` in [`../week-12/aws-certification/`](../week-12/aws-certification/) **today**, and run it every day for the rest of the plan. It is the part that cannot be crammed.

## Done means

- `week-01/aws-from-scratch/` prints 24/24.
- You can state IAM's evaluation rule from memory and say why policy order cannot change the answer.
- You can explain why a hot partition key throttles a table that looks idle.
- The drill is running and has a streak.

## Every day

1. **Implement** — longest block, first thing, hardest unfinished stub.
2. **Predict, then run** — write the number you expect before you run the demo. A surprise is a gap a passing test did not reveal.
3. **Make it green** — `python3 check.py` where one exists.
4. **Log, ten minutes** — one entry in [`../journal/`](../journal/).

**Sunday is regression day. No new code.** Re-run every checker built so far and write two sentences on what you can now re-derive that you could not last Sunday.
