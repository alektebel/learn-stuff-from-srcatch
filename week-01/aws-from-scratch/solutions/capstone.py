"""
Capstone — a serverless application from the pieces. Complete Solution.

    upload to S3
      -> S3 event notification
        -> SNS topic (fanout, with a filter policy)
          -> SQS queue (durable buffer)
            -> Lambda (concurrency-limited)
              -> DynamoDB (partition-keyed, throttleable)
    with KMS encrypting the payload and IAM gating every single call.

The point is not that it works. It is that the FAILURES compose too, and each
one is a mechanism you built and can now recognise anywhere:

  IAM denies      -> the call never happens, and the error names the statement
  Lambda throttle -> events queue instead of being lost, because SQS buffers
  Dynamo throttle -> a hot partition key, not a capacity shortage
  Poison event    -> retried, then dead-lettered rather than retried forever
