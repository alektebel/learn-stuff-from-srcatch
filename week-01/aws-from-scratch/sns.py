"""
SNS + EventBridge — fanout and pattern matching. Complete Solution.

DESIGN DECISION — push or pull?
  SQS is pull: a consumer asks, and a message waits until someone does.
  SNS is push: the topic delivers to every subscriber, now, and if a subscriber
  is down the message is retried and then dropped.
  CHOSEN: model push, and model the consequence — the classic architecture is
  SNS *in front of* SQS precisely so that fanout gets push semantics while each
  consumer keeps a durable buffer it controls.

DESIGN DECISION — filter at the subscriber or at the topic?
  Filtering in the subscriber is simpler and costs you a delivery per message
  per subscriber, most of which get thrown away.
  CHOSEN: filter policies evaluated at the topic. It also forces the semantics
  into the open: attributes AND across keys, OR within a key's value list —
  the same rule as IAM conditions, and wrong-footed for the same reason.
