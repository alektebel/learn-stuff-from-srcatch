progress.py — where you actually are against the 18-week plan in ROADMAP.md.

    python3 progress.py                 # the core track, this week
    python3 progress.py --track full    # all 41 directories
    python3 progress.py --track spine   # the 12-directory minimum
    python3 progress.py --week 7        # pretend it is week 7
    python3 progress.py --checks        # also run every check.py (slower, exact)

Counting is deliberately crude, because a progress tool you do not trust is a
progress tool you stop running. It counts the markers left in the templates:

    Python   `raise NotImplementedError`, falling back to `# TODO`
    Lean     `sorry`
    Haskell  `= undefined` and `-- TODO`
    C / CUDA `TODO`

Two consequences worth knowing before you rely on the number:

  * The Python count is honest — the marker disappears when you implement the
    function, because the function no longer raises.
  * The C, CUDA and Haskell counts are NOT honest unless you DELETE each TODO
    comment as you satisfy it. Do that. It costs nothing and it is the only
    thing keeping those bars meaningful.
  * `--checks` is the number that cannot be gamed: it runs every graded
    checker in the repo and reports what actually passes. Trust that column
    over the bars.

Two directories (vllm-engine, tensorrt-inference) are design briefs with no
template to count. They are tracked by hours only, and their real completion
signal is whether their README's benchmarks run.
