"""
IAM — policy evaluation. Complete Solution.

The most valuable service to implement, because the evaluation rule is short,
counter-intuitive, and everybody gets it wrong at least once:

    1. An explicit DENY anywhere always wins.
    2. Otherwise, an explicit ALLOW grants access.
    3. Otherwise, DENY (implicit).

That is it. Everything else — wildcards, conditions, NotAction, boundaries — is
detail hung off those three lines.

DESIGN DECISION — evaluate statements in order, or partition by effect?
  Reading statements top-to-bottom and letting the last one win is how firewall
  rules work, and it is what people expect.
  CHOSEN: partition by effect. Collect every matching Deny, then every matching
  Allow. Order is irrelevant. This is what AWS actually does, and it is why
  moving a statement in a policy document never changes the outcome — a
  property worth having, and worth proving to yourself.

DESIGN DECISION — how much of the condition language to support?
  The real one has dozens of operators, set semantics, policy variables.
  CHOSEN: StringEquals, StringLike, Bool, IpAddress, NumericLessThan and
  ArnLike. Enough to show that conditions AND across keys and OR within a key —
  the rule that surprises people — without drowning in operators.
