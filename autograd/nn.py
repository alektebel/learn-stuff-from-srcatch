"""
nn — layers, and what a "module" actually is. Complete Solution.

A layer is two things: some tensors that need gradients, and a function that
uses them. That is the whole abstraction, and everything else `nn.Module` does
is bookkeeping around those two facts.

DESIGN DECISION — why does a Module exist at all, when a function would do?
  `def linear(x, w, b): return x @ w + b` is a layer. It is also unusable in a
  network, because the optimiser needs to find `w` and `b`, the checkpointer
  needs to name them, and the training loop needs to zero them. A bare function
  hands you no way to enumerate its own state.
  CHOSEN: Module owns `parameters()`, recursively. Everything downstream —
  optimisers, `zero_grad`, saving, freezing a layer — is one traversal of that
  list. Note what this means: a tensor that is not reachable from
  `parameters()` never gets updated, and the symptom is a network that trains
  but plateaus early, with no error anywhere.

DESIGN DECISION — how are weights initialised?
  Zeros are the obvious choice and they are catastrophic: every unit in a layer
  computes the same thing, receives the same gradient, and stays identical
  forever. The layer has one effective neuron no matter how wide it is.
  CHOSEN: scaled random init — He for ReLU, Xavier for tanh — with the scale
  derived from fan-in rather than picked. The demo measures what happens at the
  wrong scale, because "initialisation matters" is unconvincing until you watch
  a 6-layer network's activations decay to 1e-8 by the output.

DESIGN DECISION — where does the nonlinearity go?
  It has to go somewhere, and the demo shows why: stack two Linear layers with
  nothing between them and you have exactly one Linear layer, because a
  composition of affine maps is an affine map. Depth without a nonlinearity is
  not depth. This is measured below rather than asserted.

Learning Path:
1. Module.parameters — recursive, and a parameter it misses is never updated
2. Linear.forward, and init_scale
3. ReLU / Tanh / Sigmoid / Sequential
4. Dropout, with the inverted scaling
5. Sequential.activations, which is the diagnostic you will use most
