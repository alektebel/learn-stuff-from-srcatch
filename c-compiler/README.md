# C Compiler Implementation

This directory contains a from-scratch implementation of a C compiler written in C.

## Goal
Build a C compiler to understand:
- Lexical analysis and tokenization
- Parsing and abstract syntax trees (AST)
- Semantic analysis and type checking
- Code generation
- Optimization techniques

## Learning Path
1. Start with a simple lexer
2. Build a recursive descent parser
3. Implement semantic analysis
4. Generate assembly or intermediate code
5. Add optimization passes
