# System Design From Scratch

A collection of from-scratch implementations covering the core building blocks of distributed systems and system design interviews.

## Goal

Build hands-on intuition for system design by implementing the patterns yourself:
- Networking primitives (HTTP, DNS, TLS basics)
- Database patterns (indexing, replication, transactions)
- Caching (LRU, cache-aside, stampede protection, TTL/eviction)
- Async systems (message queues, retries, backoff, DLQ, idempotency)
- Reliability patterns (circuit breaker, timeout, bulkhead, backpressure)
- Classic small designs (URL shortener, rate limiter, leaderboard, notifications)
- Capacity math (QPS, storage/day, bandwidth, cache hit ratio)
- Observability (structured logging, metrics, tracing)

## Learning Path

### 1. Foundations — Networking & OS Basics
> *Already covered in this repo:* `http-server/`, `dns-server/`, `firewall-from-scratch/`

Key concepts to understand before system design:
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: request/response cycle, headers, status codes, keep-alive, TLS handshake
- **DNS**: resolution chain, TTL, caching at resolver, A/CNAME/MX records
- **TCP**: 3-way handshake, flow control, retransmission, TIME_WAIT
- **TLS**: certificate chain, cipher suites, session resumption
- **Latency numbers**: memory (~100ns), SSD (~100µs), network RTT (~1ms LAN, ~100ms cross-region)
- **OS basics**: threads vs processes, context switching cost, virtual memory, file descriptors

---

### 2. Databases
Key concepts:
- **Indexing**: B-tree vs hash index, composite indexes, covering index, index selectivity
- **Transactions & ACID**: atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability
- **Isolation levels**: read uncommitted → read committed → repeatable read → serializable
- **Replication**: leader-follower, synchronous vs async replication, replication lag
- **SQL vs NoSQL**: when to use each, trade-offs (schema flexibility, joins, consistency)
- **Sharding & partitioning**: horizontal vs vertical, hot partitions, consistent hashing

---

### 3. Caching
**Template**: [`cache.py`](cache.py)

Key concepts:
- **LRU/LFU eviction policies**
- **Cache-aside pattern**: app reads from cache, on miss fetches DB and writes to cache
- **Write-through / write-back patterns**
- **TTL**: time-to-live, staleness trade-offs
- **Cache stampede (thundering herd)**: many simultaneous misses hit DB; mitigated with locking/jitter
- **Cache invalidation**: hardest problem — on write, either delete or update cache entry
- **Redis basics**: single-threaded event loop, data structures (string, hash, list, set, sorted set)
- **CDN basics**: edge caches, cache-control headers, origin shield, purging

---

### 4. Async Systems
**Template**: [`message_queue.py`](message_queue.py)

Key concepts:
- **Queues vs streams**: queues consume and delete (SQS); streams retain and replay (Kafka)
- **At-least-once delivery**: messages may be redelivered — consumers must be idempotent
- **Retries & exponential backoff**: `delay = base * 2^attempt + jitter`
- **Dead-letter queue (DLQ)**: messages that fail N times go to DLQ for inspection
- **Idempotency**: same operation applied multiple times = same result (use idempotency keys)
- **Deduplication**: deduplicate by message ID in a seen-set with TTL
- **Scheduled jobs**: cron-like triggers, at-least-once semantics, leader election for single-runner

---

### 5. Small Designs (Practice Problems)
**Templates**:
- [`url_shortener.py`](url_shortener.py) — URL shortener
- [`rate_limiter.py`](rate_limiter.py) — Token bucket / sliding window rate limiter
- [`consistent_hash.py`](consistent_hash.py) — Consistent hashing ring

#### URL Shortener
- **API**: `POST /shorten` → `{short_url}`, `GET /{code}` → redirect
- **Data model**: `urls(code PK, long_url, created_at, expires_at, hits)`
- **Encoding**: base62 over auto-increment ID or random 6-char code
- **Scale**: 100M URLs, 10:1 read/write, ~1KB/entry → ~100GB storage, cache top URLs

#### Rate Limiter
- **Algorithms**: token bucket (allows bursts), sliding window log (precise), sliding window counter (efficient)
- **Storage**: Redis `INCR` + `EXPIRE` per key
- **Distributed**: same Redis key across instances; careful with clock skew

#### Notifications System
- **Components**: event producers → message queue → fanout workers → push/email/SMS gateways
- **Idempotency**: deduplicate by `(user_id, event_id)`
- **Rate limiting**: don't spam users — per-user daily limits

#### Comments System
- **Data model**: `comments(id, post_id, parent_id, user_id, body, created_at)` — adjacency list for tree
- **Pagination**: keyset pagination on `(post_id, created_at, id)`
- **Denormalization**: cache comment count on posts table

#### File Upload + Processing
- **Flow**: client → presigned S3 URL → upload direct to object store → S3 event → queue → worker processes file
- **Chunked upload**: split large files, upload parts, multipart complete
- **Processing pipeline**: transcode/resize as async job; store output in S3; update DB

#### Leaderboard
**Template**: [`leaderboard.py`](leaderboard.py)
- **Data model**: Redis sorted set `ZADD leaderboard score user_id`, `ZREVRANK` for rank
- **Persistence**: periodic snapshot to DB; Redis as fast read layer
- **Scale**: top-K with `ZREVRANGE`; windowed leaderboards with time-bucketed keys

---

### 6. APIs + Data Model
For every design, write out:
```
Endpoints:
  POST   /resource         → create
  GET    /resource/{id}    → read
  PUT    /resource/{id}    → update (full)
  PATCH  /resource/{id}    → update (partial)
  DELETE /resource/{id}    → delete
  GET    /resource?cursor=&limit=  → paginated list

Request/Response: JSON with camelCase, ISO-8601 dates, pagination envelope
  { "data": [...], "nextCursor": "...", "total": 1000 }

Tables/Keys: choose partition key to avoid hot partitions
  - spread writes by hashing user_id, not by timestamp
  - composite keys: (tenant_id, entity_id) for multi-tenant

Schema evolution:
  - add nullable columns only (backward compatible)
  - use migrations with rollback scripts
  - avoid renaming columns without dual-write period
```

---

### 7. Capacity Math
**Template**: [`capacity_planner.py`](capacity_planner.py)

Always work through:
```
Given: 10M DAU, 10 reads/user/day, 1 write/user/day

QPS (reads):  10M * 10 / 86400 ≈ 1,160 QPS
QPS (writes): 10M * 1  / 86400 ≈ 116 QPS
Peak:         ~3x average      ≈ 3,500 QPS reads

Payload: 1 KB per read response
Bandwidth: 1,160 QPS * 1 KB = ~1.1 MB/s

Storage/day (writes): 116 writes/s * 1 KB * 86400s ≈ 10 GB/day
Storage/year: 10 GB * 365 ≈ 3.65 TB

Cache: assume 80% hit ratio → only 20% hit DB = 232 QPS to DB
DB sizing: 232 QPS, 5ms avg query → need ~2 replicas
```

---

### 8. Reliability Patterns
**Template**: [`circuit_breaker.py`](circuit_breaker.py)

Key patterns:
- **Timeout**: every outbound call must have a timeout; use deadline propagation
- **Retry with backoff**: `delay = min(cap, base * 2^n) + random_jitter`; only retry idempotent ops
- **Circuit breaker**: CLOSED → OPEN (on failures) → HALF-OPEN (probe) → CLOSED
- **Load shedding**: drop low-priority requests when overloaded; return 503 with `Retry-After`
- **Backpressure**: signal upstream to slow down; bounded queues reject when full
- **Bulkhead**: isolate resource pools per caller/tenant so one bad actor can't exhaust all connections
- **Graceful degradation**: return stale data / partial results rather than full failure
- **Multi-AZ**: deploy across availability zones; use health checks + automatic failover

---

### 9. Observability
Key concepts:
- **Logs**: structured (JSON), include `trace_id`, `request_id`, `user_id`, severity levels
- **Metrics**: counters (requests total), gauges (queue depth), histograms (latency p50/p99)
- **Traces**: distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), span per service hop, visualize with Jaeger/Zipkin
- **SLO/SLA**: define SLOs (e.g. p99 < 200ms, 99.9% availability); alert when error budget burns fast
- **Alerting**: alert on symptoms (high error rate, latency spike) not causes (high CPU)
- **Dashboards**: golden signals — latency, traffic (RPS), errors, saturation (USE method)
- **Debugging slowdowns**: check p99 latency, trace slow requests, look for lock contention, GC pauses
